# jspm-react

JSPM React Project Boilerplate

### Get Started

After cloning the repository, run:

`npm install`

Then spin up your favourite local webserver (such as
https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), and open index.html in a browser.

### Compile

`npm run build`

Concatenate the app with all of its dependencies, preserving module scopes and
minify the result.  You can include the result directly into your browser via
`<script>` tags.

That's all!
