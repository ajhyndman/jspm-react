# jspm-react

JSPM React Project Boilerplate

### Get Started

After cloning the repository, run:

`npm install`

Then spin up your favourite local webserver (such as
https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), and open index.html in a browser.

### Compile

`npm run build` (or `npm run watch`)

Compile ES6 and JSX code, concatenate the app file with all of its dependencies,
preserving module scopes and minify the result.  You can include the result
directly into your browser via `<script>` tags.

That's all!
